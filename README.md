Interview Task

## My Approach

### Project Structure
I made use of the feature first project structure to achieve the final goal, where each feature should have the following;

- Data Layer: For Communication with the backend.
- Domain Layer: Where model classes specific to the feature are stored.
- Presentation Layer: All widgets and screens go into this folder.

This choice of project structure allows for seperation of concerns, reusable code and scalability.

Below is an image of the project structure

Colors, app constants, fonts were all seperated into their different files under the constants folder, similarly a common widgets folder was created for widgets that are not specific to on feature.

I also made use of varius reusable widgets to make my code more readable, for example take a look at the home screen ðŸ‘‡

As seen above, with less than 100 lines of code, i was able to render the complex design on figma.
